  ## About me

  
content: >
  #### I am a senior graduating in December 2021. 
  
  I have been a follower of Technology since I was 11years old and it would be a privilege to contribute to its growth and future successes in a Software Developer role.
  I believe my ability to coordinate strategies and objectives in a project with the established and emerging Computer Science paradigms helps me to have greatest operational effect with the least amount of resources.
  I am  passionate about finding solutions to our society's most  pressing issues. Many of the existing  systems are incompatible with the productivity needed for a strong society. I want to use Computer  Science as a resource to build new, creative ways to influence social change.
  The modern era in which we live has the ability to revolutionize the way we work and connect, which has prompted me to join in. I enjoy imagining and researching what the future of technology would be like, and I hope to have a hand in that future.

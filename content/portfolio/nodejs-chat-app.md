challenge: Translating everyone’s desires into implementable action points, 
  while avoiding conflicts, is key. Ensuring that everyone is okay with the 
  finalized implementation plan, before starting development, is also vital. 
  All these reasons warrant the use of inter-tool collaboration for timely and seamless communication during software development.
solution: Collaborating on software development is hard. That is the reason cloudgile exists.
  It is a cloud-based platform that allows users to collaborate in an agile manner. It provides essential tools that already existing applications lack such as in-built communication supporting in-app messaging, voice
  chat and video chat along with integration of git that allows automating user’s
  progress along the development of their project.

challenge:
  Multi-user chat applications nowadays use Cloud Platforms to collect all the data from the application and store it for the users to use it later. With no cloud platform involved in the project it was a challenge to implement a functionality which can hold all the data from multiple users using the application at the same time.
solution: 
  This project uses Serializable interface of Java programming language. Serialization in Java allows us to convert an Java Object to Byte stream that we can send over the network or save it as file or store in Database for later usage.

challenge: Classification model types can be challenging because each model type has its own characteristic, 
  which could be a strength or weakness depending on the problem. Classification models assign items to a discrete group or class based on a specific set of features.Determining the best classification model often presents difficulties given the uniqueness of each dataset and desired outcome. Overfitting occurs when the model is too closely aligned with limited training data that may contain noise or errors. An overfit model is not able to generalize well to data outside the training set, limiting its usefulness in a production system.
solution: By identifying the types of classifications needed and purpose of data, 
  it makes easier for us to differentiate among them - 
  
  * Try to identify 
  - What is the model meant to accomplish?  
  - How much data is there, and what type of data is it?
  - How much detail is needed? Is storage a limiting factor?
